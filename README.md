# FATAL DUEL

This is a 1 vs 1 fighting game. The inspiration for the game is taken from a popular game by the name of Shadow Fighters. This is a story based game.



## Story
Two mafia groups, the Obsidian Brotherhood and the Midnight Ravens, are vying for control of the underworld. To settle the dispute, they have agreed to a duel between their best representatives: Salvatore Romano of the Obsidian Brotherhood and Dominic Valentino of the Midnight Ravens.

## GamePlay
The game is a one-on-one fighting game in which the player controls either Salvatore Romano or Dominic Valentino. The goal is to defeat the opponent by reducing their health to zero.

Every attack from a player that results in damage to the other player earns a point for their mafia group. The mafia group with the most points at the end of the game wins control of the underworld.

## Features

- Player Selection: At the beginning of the game, the player chooses which mafia group they want to represent.

- Time Limit: Players now have 1 minute to defeat their opponent. If neither player has defeated the other by the end of the time limit, there is a rematch.

- Health Regeneration: If a player doesn't lose any health for 10 seconds, they gain 1/5 of their total health back.

The game has two modes:

- 2 Player: Two human players compete against each other, each choosing a mafia group to represent.

- Computer vs Human: The player competes against a computer-controlled opponent.
